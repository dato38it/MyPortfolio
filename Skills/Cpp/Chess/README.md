<p><strong>Task:</strong><br>chess rook<br>The chess rook moves horizontally or vertically. Given two different cells of the chessboard, determine whether the rook can get from the first cell to the second one in one move. The program receives four numbers from 1 to 8 each, specifying the column number and row number first for the first cell, then for the second cell. The program should output YES if it is possible to get into the second cell from the first cell by the move of the rook, or NO otherwise.<br><strong>Task:</strong><br>Chess King<br>The chess king moves horizontally, vertically and diagonally, but only by 1 square. Given two different squares of the chessboard, determine whether the king can get from the first square to the second one in one move. The program receives four numbers from 1 to 8 each, specifying the column number and row number first for the first cell, then for the second cell. The program should output YES if it is possible to get to the second square from the first square by the king's move, or NO otherwise.<br><strong>Task:</strong><br>Chess bishop<br>Chess bishop moves diagonally. Given two different cells of the chessboard, determine whether the bishop can get from the first cell to the second one in one move. The program receives four numbers from 1 to 8 each, specifying the column number and row number first for the first cell, then for the second cell. The program should output YES if it is possible to get into the second cell from the first cell by the bishop's move, or NO otherwise.<br><strong>Task:</strong><br>Chess queen<br>The chess queen moves diagonally, horizontally or vertically. Given two different cells of the chessboard, determine whether the queen can get from the first cell to the second one in one move.

The program receives four numbers from 1 to 8 each, specifying the column number and row number first for the first cell, then for the second cell. The program should output YES if it is possible to get to the second square from the first square by the knight's move, or NO otherwise.</p>
